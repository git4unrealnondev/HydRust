# Rust-Hydrus
Rust mem safe code memery.

# Note only place where unsafe code is used is in the ./scrapers/scraper.rs file
# This is for libloading but otherwise everything else is safe :D

This is still in active development. 
Please do not use for anything serious.

This is designed to be a fast and rapid clone for Hydrus based on plugins and user expandability. 
This is done specifically because I'm lazy and I don't like how some things are done with Hyrdrus & Python. 

This source ideally uses a lib c plugin system that is designed for maximum exapndability and speed. 
If you don't like something then submit a PR to change it. 

I'm active on github mostly so make an issue if you have one. 

docs folder has more info coming soon. :D

WEBUI not yet finished still need to workout how to make (leptos? and actix?) work properly.
